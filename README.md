Tropical cyclones (TCs) are among the most destructive weather phenomena, significantly impacting atmosphere-ocean interactions and coastal communities. Accurate TC wind field datasets are critical for forecasting, understanding TC dynamics, and assessing oceanic responses. However, existing reanalysis datasets, such as ERA5, have notable limitations in representing TC inner-core dynamics, often underestimating peak wind speeds and poorly resolving storm structures. This study presents a novel global reconstruction of ERA5 TC wind fields using an integrated parametric correction approach. Our methodology combines the Willoughby adjustment method for open-ocean TCs, a proportional correction for landfalling TCs, and a novel weight-based fusion method to ensure smooth transitions in nearshore regions. Validation against various data demonstrates substantial improvements in the accuracy of reconstructed TC tracks, maximum wind speeds (MWS), and radius of maximum wind (RMW). Compared to the original ERA5, the reconstructed dataset effectively mitigates wind speed underestimations, especially in TC inner-core regions, resulting in a more precise depiction of storm intensity and structure. Despite of minor limitations, this global reconstructed dataset significantly enhances accuracy and reliability, serving as a valuable resource to advance TC forecasting, research, and disaster resilience strategies.
